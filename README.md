Using Device Handlers With Shelly products

Different Shelly devices require varied settings. Device handlers for Shelly sensors require the use of an MQTT broker. Shelly modules with multiple relays or channels - Shelly 2.5, Shelly 4Pro, & Shelly RGBW2, for example - require that you select the specific channel for the device handler to work with.

The instructions assume you've already added the device handler using the steps above.

1. Navigate to your Hubitat's IP address in your web browser
2. Click Devices
3. Click the Add Virtual Device button
4. Enter a Device Name and Device Label for the Shelly module
5. Select  the appropriate device handler from the "User" section in the "Type" menu
6. Click the "Save Device" button
7. Enter valid settings for any field marked with an asterisk. For example: Shelly As A Switch, for use with a Shelly 2.5 relay. Enter valid values for IP address and Relay Channel (choices will be o or 1 for the Shelly 2.5).  *Note:* For the Shelly 2.5, you will set up a second instance of the device handler for the second relay channel.
8. Click Save Preferences
9. When "Current States" populates with valid data for your device, the device handler is configured properly.
